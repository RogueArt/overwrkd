# Pom

Pom is a simple pomodoro timer meant to be used as either a CLI tool or as a desktop GUI tool. It's platform compatible with all major operating systems and is written in the Rust language.

The motivation to write this in Rust came from the language's low memory footprint as well as the small sizes of the binaries making it easy to distribute.

# Install

Downloadable executables for all major platforms will be added once Pom reaches version 1.0.0.

For now, you can build this yourself by installing Rust as shown [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Then you can clone this repository and build it via the terminal by running from the root of the directory:

> cargo build --release

Cargo will automatically install dependencies and compile it under /target.
