# About

Overwrkd is a GUI application that helps you take proper breaks and prevents you from overworking. It can be used a Daemon that notifies you to take a break or a GUI app that shows you how it's tracking what kind of work you're doing. It's platform compatible with all major operating systems and can be used as a web app. More information will be added once Overwrkd reaches version 1.0.0.

Pom is meant to be an improvement over the current loop timer I'm using. See [here](https://github.com/RogueArt/loop-timer/) for my **Windows only** loop timer.

# Getting Started

Downloadable executables for all major platforms will be added once Pom reaches version 1.0.0.

To build it yourself, follow these steps:
1. Install Rust from the [official Rust lang website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Clone this repository using `https://github.com/RogueArt/pom.git`
3. Build both executables for your current platform with `cargo build --release`. 

Executables (cli.exe and gui.exe) can be found under `./target/debug`. This will take up to a minute depending on the speed of your computer.

Note: Cargo, the package manager for Rust, will automatically install and compile any needed dependencies.
