# Pom

Pom is a sipmle pomodoro timer meant to be used as either a CLI tool or as a desktop GUI tool. It's platform compatible with all major operating systems and is written in the Rust language.

# Install

Downloadable executables will be added once Pom reaches version 1.0.0.

For now, you can build this yourself by installing Rust as shown [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Then you can clone this repository and build it via the terminal by running from the root of the directory:

> cargo build --release

Cargo will automatically install dependencies and compile it under /target.
