# About

Pom is a customizable pomodoro timer that comes in various flavors. It can be used as either a CLI tool or as a desktop GUI tool and it's platform compatible with all major operating systems. More information will be added as Pom reaches version 1.0.0.

Pom is meant to be an improvement over the current loop timer I'm using. See [here](https://github.com/RogueArt/loop-timer/) for my **Windows only** loop timer.

# Getting Started

Downloadable executables for all major platforms will be added once Pom reaches version 1.0.0.

To build it yourself, follow these steps:
1. Install Rust from the [official Rust lang website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Clone this repository using `https://github.com/RogueArt/pom.git`
3. Build both executables for your current platform with `cargo build --release`. 

Executables (cli.exe and gui.exe) can be found under `./target/debug`. This will take up to a minute depending on the speed of your computer.

Note: Cargo, the package manager for Rust, will automatically install and compile any needed dependencies.
