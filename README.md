# About

Pom is a customizable pomodoro timer that comes in various flavors. It can be used as either a CLI tool or as a desktop GUI tool and it's platform compatible with all major operating systems. More information will be added as Pom reaches version 1.0.0.

# Inspiration

Pom is meant to be an improvement over the current loop timer I'm using. See [here](https://github.com/RogueArt/loop-timer/) for my **Windows only** loop timer.

# Getting Started

Downloadable executables for all major platforms will be added once Pom reaches version 1.0.0.

For now, you can build this yourself by installing Rust as shown [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Then you can clone this repository and build it via the terminal by running from the root of the directory:

> cargo build --release

Cargo will automatically install dependencies and compile it under /target.
